Hi! I'm Leraxa. I'm currently doing my mandatory internship at  
Soloplan GmbH as a Junior Developer. My main programming language is C#.  
  
In my freetime, I like to play video games like League of Legends or Lethal company with my friends :)

I am currently learning Unreal Engine 5 and expanding my skills in Blender.   
Stay tuned!
